#+TITLE: Roadmap
#+DESCRIPTION: A simple roadmap for the project
#+AUTHOR: FeistyKit

I'd like to start off with saying that this is the first time I've ever used org-mode, so I'm sorry if it looks bad.

Anyways, the roadmap for the project:

- [ ] tui for the program
- [ ] decide upon sorted items
- [ ] Decide whether or not to include a parser to generate cards from other sources like [[www.conjuguemos.com]] for example
  -- Link to another repository?
  -- Compile-time feature?
- [ ] Parse a list into vocab cards
